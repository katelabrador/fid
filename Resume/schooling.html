<h1>Schooling</h1>
<p>I am a high school senior and will be graduating in the year 2024 with my Associates in arts. I have taken several college level courses pertaining to graphic design as well as my first in web design. These course have provided me with tools and skills that will help me to give my very best as a graphic designer. I have plans in the future to continue taking courses to improve my skill in this line of work.</p><a href="resume.html">Back to main page</a></p>
