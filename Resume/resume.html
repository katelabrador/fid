<section id="About"><h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I am a young and witty aspiring Graphic artist. I have been involved in graphic design for over three years now. I am familiar with programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate. I am most proficient in the later two as they are my favorite programs. Though I am only a high school senior, my experience and ability to learn fast would make me a great fit in your program.</p>

<section id="experience">  <h1>My Experience</h1>
<p>Though I have no previous work history in graphic design, my work ethic is evident in the time that I've spent working in the school system with children. I was trained through my experince with them and caught on fast. I believe that my ability to do so would make me a good candidate. My history in instructing students alongside the teachers has also given me the unique oppurtunity to better understand how to teach others.</p></section>
