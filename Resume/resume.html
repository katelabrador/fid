<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I am a young and witty aspiring Graphic artist. I have been involved in graphic design for over three years now. I have am familiar with programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate. I am most proficient in the later two as they are my favorite programs. Though I am only a high school senior, my experience and ability to learn fast would make me a great fit in your program.</p>
