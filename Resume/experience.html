<h1>My Experience</h1>
<p>Though I have no previous work history in graphic design, my work ethic is evident in the time that I've spent working in the school system with children. I was trained through my experince with them and caught on fast. I believe that my ability to do so would make me a good candidate. My history in instructing students alongside the teachers has also given me the unique oppurtunity to better understand how to teach others.</p>
